#
# Checks the AppImage against SHA256SUMS, and starts it only if they match.
#
# WHO THIS IS FOR
# ===============
# Someone standing at an offline Tails machine who does not use a terminal, has been handed a
# USB stick, and has no documentation except READ-THIS-FIRST.txt beside this file. Every choice
# below follows from that.
#
# WHY A DIALOG AND NOT AN ECHO
# ============================
# Double-clicked from the file manager, this script has no terminal attached, so anything printed
# to stdout or stderr goes nowhere. A verification that fails silently is worse than none: it
# teaches the user that the check "worked" whenever nothing appeared. So results go through
# zenity, which Tails ships (4.1.90 in the 7.10.1 manifest, checked rather than assumed). If
# zenity is somehow absent the messages fall back to stderr, which is also the path CI exercises,
# since the runner has no zenity.
#
# WHAT THIS CHECK IS AND IS NOT
# =============================
# SHA256SUMS travels in the same folder as the AppImage it describes, so this proves the file is
# the one that was packaged with these instructions: not truncated, not corrupted by the copy,
# not altered on the stick afterwards. It is NOT a signature and it cannot tell anyone the
# download was genuine, because whoever could replace the AppImage could replace SHA256SUMS and
# this script along with it. Whoever handed over the stick is who is being trusted for that.
# READ-THIS-FIRST.txt says so in plain words, and neither file may ever imply otherwise.
#
# WHY IT ALSO LAUNCHES THE APP
# ============================
# Because otherwise nobody runs it. The alternative is telling a non-technical user to verify by
# hand and then launch by hand, at which point the verification is the step that gets skipped.
# Launching here means the only route to the app is the one that checks it first.
#
# THE EXECUTABLE BIT, AND WHY THE APPIMAGE ARRIVES WITHOUT ONE
# ============================================================
# Settled on a real Tails session rather than reasoned about: Archive Manager restores the modes
# stored in the zip, so this script arrives runnable. Tails has no unzip command, so extraction is
# the GUI path or 7z, and the GUI path preserves the bit.
#
# That is also why the AppImage is stored 644. If it arrived at 755 it would open on a double-click,
# which is easier than right-clicking this script, so the quickest way into the app would be the way
# that skips the check. The chmod below is what makes it runnable, and it happens only after the
# hash matches. Bypassing that needs a deliberate trip through Properties.
#
# The instructions still explain how to set the bit on this file, for an extractor that drops modes.
# Nothing here depends on the archive carrying them.
#
# GNOME Files opens an executable .sh in the text editor on a double-click, so the instructions say
# to right-click and choose "Run as a Program". A binary is different: an AppImage with its bit set
# launches on a double-click on nautilus 48.3, which is the behaviour this bundle deliberately
# withholds until the check has run.
